        Opaque HP and Ammo bars
----------------------------------------------

As of Beta 9.11.2020, the HP and Ammo bars are made to be defaulted as transparent objects. If you would still like to use the old opaque bars, navigate to 'customization/opaquebars' folder and open 'hpbar.res' and 'ammo.res'. Follow the instructions in both of those files to make the changes you want.

----------------------------------------------
        Health bar fixes
----------------------------------------------

The horizontal health bar effect does not play well with varying resolutions. Check out 'customization/hpbar_resolutions/hpbar.res' file to fix it for your resolution.
If you are using 1920x1080, you *should* not have to change this value.

----------------------------------------------
        HUD Crosshairs
----------------------------------------------

To enable HUD crosshairs, navigate to the 'customization' folder and open 'crosshair.res'.
Follow the instructions in that file to enable your custom crosshair.

Make sure you change 'cl_crosshair_scale' to 0 to hide the vanilla TF2 crosshairs

----------------------------------------------
        Transparent Viewmodels
----------------------------------------------
To enable transparent viewmodels, navigate to the 'customization' folder and open 'transparent_viewmodels.res'.
Follow the instructions listed, and ensure that the following batch of commands are in your autoexec.cfg.

// Prism Settings (for refract)

mat_motion_blur_enabled 1 			//afaik the only sure-fire way to keep refract masking on
mat_motion_blur_strength 0 			//effectively disables motion blur, personal choice + motion blur gets masked and looks bad with refract masking
mat_disable_bloom 1 				//disables bloom so refract masking doesn't create a dark rectangle over light materials
mat_hdr_level 0
mat_colcorrection_disableentities 1
mat_colorcorrection 0



If you do not have a custom autoexec.cfg, navigate to the 'custom' folder and create a new folder named 'myconfigs'. In that folder make another folder named 'cfg', then after that place a file named autoexec.cfg in the 'cfg' folder. This file will be a list of commands run everytime you launch your game. Paste the above commands into this file and save. Reload TF2 for this to take effect.

        HUD Colors
----------------------------------------------

Dislike a certain color? Navigate to 'customization/static_hud_colors.res' where you can feel free to change the color of any of the base HUD colors. Please note, this will not change the color of the main menu borders and backgrounds, as they are handled with VTFs.

    shYellow        Controls scoreboard assist label and MvM wave count color
